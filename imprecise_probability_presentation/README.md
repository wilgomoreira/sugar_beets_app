# Imprecise Probability Presentation

This project contains a PowerPoint presentation summarizing the content and functionality of the `imprecise_probabilityV2.ipynb` file. The presentation is designed to provide an overview of the key concepts and methods used in the notebook, which focuses on imprecise probabilities in the context of machine learning.

## Presentation Overview

The PowerPoint presentation (`slides/imprecise_probabilityV2_summary.pptx`) includes the following main sections:

1. **Loading Data**: An introduction to how training and testing logits/likelihoods are loaded from files.
2. **Obtaining Lower Bounds**: A discussion on how lower bounds are calculated from the probabilities.
3. **Visualizing Distributions**: Techniques for visualizing the distribution of likelihoods by class.
4. **Implementing Imprecise Functions**: An overview of functions that handle imprecise probabilities and their applications.
5. **Evaluating Metrics**: Metrics used to assess the performance of the model, including Average Precision and Expected Calibration Error.
